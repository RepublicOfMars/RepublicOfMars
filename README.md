I make funny programs that crash whatever server they're run on

### Stuff about me
- I remade Minecraft using a 2d rendering software : https://github.com/RepublicOfMars/IGIS_Craft
- Got a bluescreen while updating a minecraft server (my solution was completely reinstalling java and it worked)
- I don't have a sleep schedule
